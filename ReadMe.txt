This package provides a way to perform math functions over 'generic integrals' as C# currently does not support this.
The C# team is working on a way to have support for generic math natively, using abstract static interfaces.
Unfortunately, this is still in preview: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/preview-features-in-net-6-generic-math/

The code of this package is adapted from:
